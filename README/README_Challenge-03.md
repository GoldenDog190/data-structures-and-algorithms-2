# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* This challenge is using a binary search to take two parameters, sorted array and the search key, to return the index of the array's elements that equals the search key.
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Wrote a method called BinarySearch, and then started with a low index and a high index length minus one. Then to check the middle we put low and high together devided by two to get the middle index. We then did a while loop to compare the middle to the number, and used if loops to slowly narrow down the numbers to the middle.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour for this challenge. First we wrote up the white board with the problem domain, a visual of how it is going to work, tests, algorithm, and the efficiency of binary search using O(login(n)) for time, and O(1) for time. Then we went to the code and made the method BinarySearch in BinarySearch.java and BinarySearch.java. Started the binary search code in the BinarySearch.java, and then worked in the BinarySearch.java. Finally tested the code to see if it worked or not.
