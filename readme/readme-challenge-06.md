# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This code challenge is about linked list insertions with three different methods. The three different mthods are .append(value), .insertBefore(value, newVal), and .insertAfter(value, newVal)
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Wrote three insertion methods for the linked list class that was set up om code challenge 5.
The three methods being used are:
  * .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
  * .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
  * .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour for the white board and code challenge. First we drew out the white board how we were going to use these methods, and wrote out what each one was going to do and how it will work. The Big O space/time for this challenge was O(1) for the append method, space: O(1) and time: O(n) for insertBefore method, and space: O(1) and time: O(n) for for insertAfter method.
