# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard with James Mansour, Cristian Robles, and Edward Hou before coding. Then I wrote out the code and tests for the challenge. The Big O space is O(), and the time is O().
