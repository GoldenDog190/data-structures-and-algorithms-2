# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard. Then I wrote out the code and tests for the challenge. The Big O space is O(n), and the time is O(n).
