# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* Solve the quick sort challenge, and write a blog about the challenge. 
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.
* Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First went over the instructions, and looked over the psuedocode. Then I set up the files I needed for this challenge. I then followed the blog example to write out the blog. I drew out the whiteboard for the blog, and wrote out a simple run through of the code. The Big O for this challenge is space O(n^2), and time O(n^2) for this challenge.
