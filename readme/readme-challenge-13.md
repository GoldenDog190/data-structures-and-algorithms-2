# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Multi-bracket Validation.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* On your main file, create a method public static boolean multiBracketValidation(String input).
* Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

  - Round Brackets : ()
  - Square Brackets : []
  - Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I worked together with Cristian Robles James Mansour, and Edward Hou on this code challenge. First drew out the problem domain, visual, and then code on the white board. Next worked on the actual code. The Big O space for this was O(n), and the time was O(1).
