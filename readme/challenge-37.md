## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard with Cristian Robles and Edward Hou before coding. Then I wrote out the code and tests for the challenge. The Big O space is O(v), and the time is O(v).
