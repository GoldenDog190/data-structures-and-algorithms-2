# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard. Then I wrote out the code and tests for the challenge. The Big O space is O(n), and the time is O(n).
