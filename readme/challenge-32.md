# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard with James Mansour, Cristian Robles, and Edward Hou before coding. Then we wrote out the code and tests for the challenge. The Big O space is , and the time is .
