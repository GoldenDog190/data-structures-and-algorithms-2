# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard. Then I wrote out the code and tests for the challenge. The Big O space is O(n), and the time is 0(n + n).

## Solution
