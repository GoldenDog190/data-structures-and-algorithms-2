# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find the k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First drew out the whiteboard with Joseph Lee, Ceylin Brooks, and Garhett Morgan before working on the code. Then we worked through the iterations of k on the white board, and worked through the code. This space and time is 0(logn).
