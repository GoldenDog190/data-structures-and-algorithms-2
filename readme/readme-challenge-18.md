# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a binary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a binary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
Return a new tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I first started it out by writing up my whiteboard, and then moved onto my code. I then wrote out my code starting with the tree with numbers, and then wrote out the tree with the fizzbuzz words. The Big O space/time is O(n). Then I wrote the tests out.
