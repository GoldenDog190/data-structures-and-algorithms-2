# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
  - enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
  - dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First wrote out the white board with Cristian Robles. Then we worked on the code and setting up the different classes. The Big O space/ time was O(n) and O(1).
