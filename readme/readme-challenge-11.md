# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

  - enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  - dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
* The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Collaborated with Joseph, Edward Hou, James Mansour, and Cristian Robles. First drew out on the whiteboard a visual of how we were going to implement a queue using two stacks. Then we wrote out how we were going to do it, and then worked on the code. The time was O(1), and the space was O(n).
