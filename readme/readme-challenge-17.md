# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Breadth-first traversal through a binary tree in order the values are encountered.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I first started it out by writing up my whiteboard, and then moved onto my code. I then wrote out my code using a breadth first approach, so that it will traverse the tree, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered. The Big O space/time is O(n). Then I wrote the tests out.
