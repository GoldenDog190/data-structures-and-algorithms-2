# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I first started it out by writing up my whiteboard, and then moved onto my code. I used the find maximum value method to find the largest value in the tree. The Big O space/time is O(n). Then I wrote the tests out.
