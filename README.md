**Challenges directory - contains code challenges from 401 Java, and the desciptions for each challenge is below:**

# Reverse an Array - Class 01
  * Reverse the array of numbers using Java with the reverseArray function.

## Challenge
  * Reversing an array using a  function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order. Input the numbers and then reverse them as your output.

## Approach & Efficiency
  * Collabotated with Edward Hou, Pablo Rosales, and James Mansour for this challenge. First made a white board in the virtual class room. We drew out what we were going to do with the challenge before doing the actual code. Then we worked through the challenge together, and went through the steps needed to finish the challenge.

# Challenge Insert Shift Array - Class 02
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* In this challenge return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Collaborated with Edward Hou, Andy Agulue, and James Mansour for this challenge. First started by setting up our files, and then started working on the white board to find out how we were going to approach this challenge. Once we had figured out what we were going to do on the white board, we started working on the code itself. After we worked on the code, and made a failure occur, which I have below.

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome 0
Expected failure: actual 4
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious) - 1 test completed, 1 failed
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':lib:test'.

Then we fixed the code, and worked on our README.md.
