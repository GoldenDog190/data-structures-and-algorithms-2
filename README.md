**Challenges directory - contains code challenges from 401 Java, and the desciptions for each challenge is below:**

# Reverse an Array - Class 01
  * Reverse the array of numbers using Java with the reverseArray function.

## Challenge
  * Reversing an array using a  function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order. Input the numbers and then reverse them as your output.

## Approach & Efficiency
  * Collabotated with Edward Hou, Pablo Rosales, and James Mansour for this challenge. First made a white board in the virtual class room. We drew out what we were going to do with the challenge before doing the actual code. Then we worked through the challenge together, and went through the steps needed to finish the challenge.
